Modern web development involves a stack of technologies, primarily HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript, in particular, has evolved into a versatile language that can run on both the client and server side (with Node.js). Frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular have simplified the creation of complex user interfaces. Performance is a key concern in modern web applications, focusing on fast load times and smooth animations.
